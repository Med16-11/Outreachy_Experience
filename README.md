## Mentoring Organization 
#### Ceph : Ceph is distributed, software-defined storage that allows users to turn commodity hardware into a massively scalable storage cluster with no single point of failure. This storage solution is able to speak object, block, and file which unifies all storage needs under a single system with self-managing and self-healing characteristics. Ceph is already integrated with many systems, including the ever-growing world of cloud offerings like OpenStack.
## About my Project
#### Making Teuthology Friendly : Teuthology is Ceph's upstream integration test framework written in Python. It currently relies heavily on users sshing into a teuthology server and execute commands to schedule, kill and update jobs.
